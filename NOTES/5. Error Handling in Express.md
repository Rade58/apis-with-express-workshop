# Express will catch your synchronous errors, to prevent server chrashing

THIS IS WHAT EXPRESS DOES FOR YOU, IF YOU WOULD THROW AN ERROR IN NORMAL NODEJS SERVER, IT WOULD CRACH LIKE ANY OTHER NODEJS APP, NO MATTER YOU HAVE SERVER OR NOT

```ts
app.get("/hello-world", (req, res) => {
  throw new Error("Hello World Error!");
});
```

SEND A RQUEST WITH HTTPIE:

```
http :3001/hello-world
```

OR WITH SOME HTTP CLIENT LIKE THUNDER CLIENT

**YOU WILL GET HTML BACK; WITH STACK TRACE OF THE ERROR THEN WAS THROWN** (**LIKE I SAID THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE WITH **)
(POSSIBLE ONLY IF YOU HAVE 'NORMAL' FUNCTION (IF YOU WOULD PUT `async/await` SERVER WOULD CRACH AND YOU WOULDN'T GET HTML WITH ERROR STACK TRACE) AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO RESTART YOUR SERVER

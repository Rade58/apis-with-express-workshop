# ABOUT MIGRATIONS

WITH MIGRATIONS YOU ARE BESICALY TEACHING YOUR RELATIONAL DATABASE INSTANCE ABOUT SHAPE OF THE DATA. RELATIONAL DATBASE STORES THE SCHEMA, BECAUSE IT HAS TO CREATE A FIXED TABLE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE SHAPE OF YOUR DATA

OR YOU DO MIGRATIONS WHEN YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE THE BREAKING CHANGE TO THE DATBASE (TERM "MIGRATION" CAME OUT OF THIS PURPOSE) (**LETS SAY YOU HAVE 1_000_000 RECORDS IN YOUR DATBASE BUT YOU WANT TO DEFINE A `OPTIONAL` UNIQUE FIELD FOR THE RELATED MODEL; YOU WOULD THEN HAVE TO DO A MIGRATION, IN THAT CASE YOU WOULD MIGRATE DATA FROM THE DATBASE AND DEFINE A NEW FIELD AND MIGRATE DATA BACK**) (**BUT IN CASE WHERE YOU DEFINE NEW REQUIRED FIELD FOR YOUR DATABSE YOU CAN'T MIGRATE DAT OUT; INITIALIZING MIGRATION WOULD WIPE ALL OF YOUR DATA**)

FOR NO-SQL DATBASES YOU DON'T NEED AND YOU CAN'T DO MIGRATIONS
